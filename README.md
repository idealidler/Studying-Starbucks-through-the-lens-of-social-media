## Starbucks Subreddit Analysis Project

This project is an analysis of the Starbucks subreddit data, aimed at understanding the most dominant topics and the internet activity trend of users based on the time of the day. The analysis was performed before and after the Covid-19 pandemic.

## Data Collection

The data was collected by scraping the Starbucks subreddit using the Python library, request and PushShiftAPI. The data collected includes all posts made on the subreddit between specific dates.

## Data Preprocessing

The collected data was preprocessed to remove irrelevant information and to prepare the data for analysis. The preprocessing steps included removing punctuation, special characters, and stop words.

## Topic Modelling

Topic modelling was performed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to identify the dominant topics discussed on the subreddit.

## Internet Activity Trend

The internet activity trend of the users was analyzed based on the time of the day the posts were made. This was done to understand the pattern of usage and to identify peak times of activity.

## Results

The results of the analysis are presented in the form of bar charts. The dominant topics and the internet activity trend before and after the Covid-19 pandemic are compared and discussed. The most dominant topics were "Employee discussion" and "Drink drink recommendations".

## Requirements

The project was developed using Python 3.8 and the following libraries:

Pandas
Matplotlib
Plotly
Seaborn
Gensim
To run the code, install the required libraries and run the Jupyter Notebook file in the repository.
